***
## Sound files
Files referenced in this doc, can be found in the `sound/pack` folder. 

Only the internal names of the sound files are given in the doc and as these are internal names, they do not have the platform identifier `.win32` string suffix at the end of the name.

XIII and XIII-2 have an additional sheet called `_us` which includes a separate set of ids for all the files when included with the english audio files. because of this reason, there can be cases where the same filename would use a different id, when included with the english audio files.
