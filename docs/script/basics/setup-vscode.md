This guide will help you set up VS Code for creating a scripting environment:

* Go to [VS Code download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and once its downloaded, install it.

* During the installation process, make sure to tick all the options excluding the desktop icon option. these options will make things easier later.

* In the settings menu searchbar, type ``java.referencesCodeLens.enabled`` and enable the option. this will ensure that all usage references are shown for the functions.
