# Types of Nova mods

This guide covers the process of installing a nova mod with the Nova mod manager.

!!! note

    There are mainly two types of Mods that are made to work with Nova Chrysalia's Unpacked filesystem mode function. 
    
    * Mod files that are packed in a .ncmp file format which has to be installed through Nova
    
    * Mod files that modify or replace the unpacked game files which only work when the game is running in **Unpacked mode**. 
      You will find this type of mods linked in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/mvqaETHjbh) in the **#releases** channel

All of these mods will require the game data to be Unpacked and will only work if the game is launched through Nova, with the Filesystem set to **Unpacked Mode**.

## Installing a NCMP mod
Here is a demo which will help to identify and install a .ncmp mod file with Nova.


1. Download the Core mods.zip file from the **#announcements** channel in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/mvqaETHjbh).

2. Extract the zip file that you downloaded and you will get lots of .ncmp files. Take notice of the filenames and you will see the short names that are used to refer to the games from the FFXIII trilogy (as explained in the [Setting up the Nova Chrysalia Mod manager](https://lr-research-team.github.io/wiki/user-guide/setting-up-nova) guide page).

3. We will install a relatively simple mod for this tutorial :a mod for LIGHTNING RETURNS: FINAL FANTASY XIII that will change the in game button prompts to PS3 button Prompts. 
Make sure that you have the LIGHTNING RETURNS: FINAL FANTASY XIII game data unpacked and setup with Nova before proceeding any further.

4. In the Nova Chrysalia mod manager, click on the _ModPack Manager_ tab at the top, then click on the **Add ModPack** option.

5. In the small window, navigate to the folder where the ncmp files are present and double click on the **[FFXIII-LR] PS3 Button Prompts** file. Doing this will add the mod to the mod list and you will have to double click on the mod from this list to select it.

6. Once you see the preview image of the mod appear on the right side, click on the **Install Mod** option and you will be prompted whether to install the mod or not. 
Click Yes and wait for the "Installation successful" prompt to appear. If that prompt appears then the mod has been installed correctly. 

7. Now click on the **Game Launcher** section and ensure that the Filesystem option is set to Unpacked. In the first row, set the dot to Final Fantasy XIII: Lightning Returns and then click on the Launch Game option. 

8. This should launch the game with the PS3 buttons now replacing the default in game buttons.


With this I hope you now have an understanding of how to install an .ncmp mod with Nova. Summing it up you add an .ncmp mod file to Nova through the **Add ModPack** option in the _ModPack Manager_ tab and once its added you select it and then install it.

Now some of the mods won't have the short name of the respective game in their filename, making it difficult to identify which game it belongs to in the FFXIII trilogy. In this case you will have to read the mod creator's instructions on which game their ncmp mod file works on.
