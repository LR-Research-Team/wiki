# Getting started

This guide covers the process of setting up the Nova mod manager for the PC version of the XIII trilogy.

!!! note

    Each game in the trilogy is sometimes referred to shortly by the modding community as follows:

    * FINAL FANTASY XIII is known as XIII-1

    * FINAL FANTASY XIII-2 is known as XIII-2

    * LIGHTNING RETURNS: FINAL FANTASY XIII is known as XIII-LR or just LR

## Game files verification

Before proceeding any further, you need to make sure that your PC version games files are clean and unmodified. You need to do this separately for each game that you own.

* Open your Steam application and in your Library section, right click on either XIII-1, or XIII-2, or LR. (just the one you have installed or the one you wish to do the setup for now).
* In the small menu that appears, click on Properties.
* Then in the new small window that opens, go to the LOCAL FILES section and there click on the verify integrity of game files... option. This should do the verification on the game files and if there is any file that was modified before, then it will be re downloaded by Steam. Once the verification and the re downloading is complete, please move to the next section.
